# eCommercePencilvania

eCommerce app selling pencils (best in class).

The purpose is to implement a cart and real payments processing. The latter utilises [Stripe's Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) object.

Not deployed, as I do not really sell these pencils.

## Features
* Product catalogue page
* Cart
* Registration and logging in for users who want to have an account
* Account page with multiple ship-to addresses and order history for users
* Placing an order with or without account
* Processing real payments
* Admin page for to adjust the products offering (CRUD)

## What it is made of
Please refer to `requirements.txt`.
